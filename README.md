# **Aussie Wealth Planner**

A comprehensive, browser-based financial forecasting tool designed to help individuals in Australia project their long-term wealth, superannuation, and financial independence. This tool allows for detailed, customisable scenarios to model various financial futures.

## **‚ú® Key Features**

The Aussie Wealth Planner is a single, self-contained HTML file with powerful features, including:

* **Scenario Management**:  
  * **Save & Load:** Save all your financial inputs and assumptions as named scenarios directly in your browser.  
  * **Compare Scenarios:** Select multiple saved scenarios and overlay their projections on the main chart for direct visual comparison of different financial strategies.  
* **Detailed Financial Modelling**:  
  * **Superannuation:** Models Superannuation Guarantee (SG) contributions, voluntary pre-tax and post-tax contributions, and simulates the 15% tax on contributions and earnings during the accumulation phase.  
  * **Retirement Drawdown:** Simulates a retirement phase where a desired annual income is drawn from the superannuation balance first, providing a realistic depletion forecast.  
  * **Dynamic Loan Repayment:** Includes a loan calculator to model the principal and interest repayments of a major loan (like a mortgage) over its term.  
  * **Asset Allocation:** Allows you to specify your portfolio mix (Growth vs. Defensive assets) and their respective expected returns for a more accurate, weighted-average investment return.  
* **Customisable Projections**:  
  * **Editable Assumptions:** Control all key variables, including desired retirement age, salary growth, inflation, and investment returns.  
  * **Life Events:** Add one-off financial events (e.g., an inheritance or a large purchase) at specific ages to see their impact on your financial trajectory.  
* **Insightful Visualisation & Analysis**:  
  * **Interactive Charting:** Visualise your net worth and superannuation balance over time. Compare multiple scenarios with clear, colour-coded graphs.  
  * **Automated Insights:** The tool automatically generates a summary of key findings, such as when your loan will be paid off or when your super might be depleted.  
  * **Year-by-Year Data Table:** View a detailed breakdown of your finances for every year of the projection.
